# Success

## When is a game successful?

--

# The romantic answer

--

## If somebody has fun playing it

Note:
- most romantic answer
- at least 1 person
- your mom, SO and friends like it
- or a stranger

--

# Financial success

--

## ~10% of all games are successful

> I couldn't even guarantee you a 10% chance of a hit anymore

### Then 1 game has to earn you enough money to make up for the other 9

--

- Success = game earns 5-10x its costs
- Moderate success = 1-2x costs
- Break even
- Failure = you loose money
- Serious failure = you earn nothing

--

### Tough business
- It is hard to predict, which game is going to be the **ONE**
- There is no job security

Note:
- big franchises tend to perform more predictably

--

## What can be done against this?

--

### Create once - publish several times
- Publish the game on several platforms
- Relabel or reskin the game

Note:
sell the same drink-collecting game for Coca-Cola and Martini with different themes

## Fail fast, fail early

--

# Feedback

- get it early
- get it constantly

--

# Prototyping
- on paper
- write throwaway code
- whatever is the cheapest, quickest

### Ask only 1 question, which you want to get answered by prototyping

--

### Concentrate on the core mechanics

## Hit Filter @ Wooga Games
> The Hit Filter is Woogaâ€™s approach to developing mobile games. The idea behind it is to whittle down lots of ideas to a handful, each with the potential of becoming a hit.

### Build a prototype in under 7 days

> Each game must be:
1. made in less than seven days
1. made by exactly one person
1. based around a common theme i.e. gravity, vegetation, etc.

Note:
- Simulate in Your Head
- If You Can Get Away With it, Fake it

--

# User testing

- invite users to play the game/prototype
- visit the user at home, if you can
- don't try to sell the game
- listen to the users, but avoid feature creep
- it is not QA (quality assurance)

Note:
Proud of AS24

They can only tell you, what made them have fun 

They can't tell you, what will make your game fun  

AS24 takes prototypes out of the building (e.g. survey at petrol station)
