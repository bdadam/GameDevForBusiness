# Performance budgets

#### Itâ€™s easier to make a fun game fast<br>than it is to make a fast game fun.<br> (Robert Nystrom)

But we still have to make it fast.

Note:
but a game must still be fast

# Time based budgets

- Startup time
- Load time, level transition time

Note:
web development has this budget

- Network (bandwidth, latency)
- Power consumption (phones, tablets, laptops)

### Testing is made easier

## within or out of budget?

## Dealing with new features
Does feature X fit into the performance budget?

--

# What can be removed instead?

Note: what are we willing to pay for it?

# Example

| | |
|-|-|
| Feature	| A new web font is needed for some fancy headlines
| Budget	| Website needs to load fast, Page speed index must stay under 1000
| Before	| Speed index 980
| After		| Speed index 1320
| Conclusion| It doesn't fit. Can something else be removed? Is it worth to "overspend"?

Note:
- Negotiation begins...
- Feature maybe only for desktop devices?
