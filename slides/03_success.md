# Success

## When is a game successful?

--

# The romantic answer

--

## If somebody has fun playing it

Note:
- most romantic answer
- at least 1 person
- your mom, SO and friends like it
- or a stranger

--

# Financial success

--

## ~10% of all games are successful

> I couldn't even guarantee you a 10% chance of a hit anymore

### Then 1 game has to earn you enough money to make up for the other 9

--

- Success = game earns 5-10x its costs
- Moderate success = 1-2x costs
- Break even
- Failure = you loose money
- Serious failure = you earn nothing

### Tough business
- It is hard to predict, which game is going to be the **ONE**
- There is no job security

Note:
- big franchises tend to perform more predictably

--

## What can be done against this?

--

### Create once - publish several times
- Publish the game on several platforms
- Relabel or reskin the game

Note:
sell the same drink-collecting game for Coca-Cola and Martini with different themes

## Fail fast, fail early

--

# Prototyping
- on paper
- write throwaway code
- MVP = Minimum Viable Product

--

# Feedback

- get it early
- get it constantly

--

# User testing

- invite users to play the game
- even in an early phase
- don't try to sell the game
- listen to the users
- it is not QA (quality assurance)

Note:
- go to the user, let them use their own gamepads
- let them sit on their own couch
- But don't do, what users tell you to do
- They can only tell you, what made them have fun
- They can't tell you, what will make your game fun
