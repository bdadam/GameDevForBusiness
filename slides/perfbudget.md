# Does this feature fit into the performance budget?

# Example

| | |
|-|-|
| Feature	| A new web font is needed for some fancy headlines
| Budget	| Website needs to load fast, Page speed index must stay under 1000
| Before	| Speed index 980
| After		| Speed index 1320
| Conclusion| It doesn't fit. Can something else be removed? Is it worth to "overspend"?

Note:
- Negotiation begins...
- Feature maybe only for desktop devices?
