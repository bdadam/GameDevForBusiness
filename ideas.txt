
# Confession
* Never developed a game
* The talk is serious (although the tag suggests fun)

## How I got here?
* Reddit r/gamedev
* Same patterns, same questions, same answers, different people


# Reduce your scope


# Why do developers develop games?
* Because they want to
* Passion
* Money doesn't matter
* They take long hours


# Why do players play games?
* It's fun
* They are polished
* There are many games


# Performance budgets
* First screen must show up after a few seconds (after inserting the disk)
* Frame budget (16.67ms)
* Response to user interaction (click, keypress) in at most 100ms
* 


# Scope
* Reduce scope
* A finished small game is much better than an unfinished but huge game
* What is the core mechanics?
* What does it make fun?


# Prototyping = MVP
* Always test the core mechanics


# User testing
* Test lab
* No influence on the user, just look at what they do
* Just thank for the feedback
* Don't promise anything


# Data Oriented Programming
* OOP is the new Goto
* OOP is dead
* Everything is just data


# Behavior Trees
* The system the user interacts with is an AI
* Communication inside the team


# Training, introduction, warmup
* Slowly showing the game mechanics - the software starts with empty data
* Guiding the user through the first levels - showing them the controls/mechanics/enemies/constraints
